    "## Overview of Black-Scholes and Heston Model Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This module contains a collection of functions for pricing European options, computing Greeks, estimating implied volatility, and simulating price paths under the Black-Scholes and Heston stochastic volatility models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Black-Scholes Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bs_call(...)`: Returns the price of a European call option using the Black-Scholes formula.\n",
    "- `bs_put(...)`: Returns the price of a European put option using the Black-Scholes formula.\n",
    "- `bs_call_delta(...)`, `bs_put_delta(...)`: Return the Delta (sensitivity to spot price) of call and put options.\n",
    "- `bs_gamma(...)`: Returns the Gamma (second derivative with respect to spot price) for both call and put options.\n",
    "- `bs_vega(...)`: Returns the Vega (sensitivity to volatility) for both call and put options.\n",
    "- `bs_call_theta(...)`, `bs_put_theta(...)`: Return the Theta (sensitivity to time) for call and put options.\n",
    "- `bs_call_rho(...)`, `bs_put_rho(...)`: Return the Rho (sensitivity to interest rate) for call and put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Simulations under Black-Scholes\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gbm_path_sim(...)`: Simulates asset paths using Geometric Brownian Motion.\n",
    "- `bs_MC_call(...)`, `bs_MC_put(...)`: Monte Carlo simulation of hedged profits from selling a call/put under Black-Scholes assumptions.\n",
    "- `bs_MC_call_fast(...)`: Faster version of `bs_MC_call` using analytic deltas for hedging.\n",
    "- `bs_MC_call_delta(...)`, `bs_MC_put_delta(...)`: Estimate Delta via Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
    "- `bs_MC_call_delta_array(...)`, `bs_MC_put_delta_array(...)`: Vectorized versions for Delta estimation over arrays of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implied Volatility Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "- `implied_volatility_call(...)`, `implied_volatility_put(...)`: Estimate implied volatility from market option prices using root-finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heston Model Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `heston_call(...)`, `heston_put(...)`: Semi-closed form solution for European call/put prices under the Heston model using numerical integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte-Carlo Simulation under Heston Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- `heston_path_sim(...)`: Simulates asset and variance paths under the Heston stochastic volatility model.\n",
    "- `heston_call_MC(...)`, `heston_put_MC(...)`: Monte Carlo pricing of European call/put options using Black-Scholes Deltas as control variates under the Heston model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte-Carlo simulations of calls and puts are paricularly useful in under standing payoff distributions of a market-maker that implements $\\Delta$-based hedging strategies to protect profits obtained from selling stock options. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes modeling serves as a baseline for understanding payoff distributions when options are hedged until expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heston modeling serves as a baseline for understanding distributions of market values of options before expiration is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
